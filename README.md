# What Is this Repository?

This repository hosts content for the documentation section of the Arduino Pro website mainly comprised of tutorials. The content needs to be written in Markdown and will be converted to HTML automatically.

# How Can I Contribute?

Contributing by creating content or suggestion changes to existing content can be done by making pull requests. CC-BY-SA-4.0 is the default license for any contribution. Sample code within this documentation is made available under the CC0 license.

You start by forking the `master` branch. Create a new branch based on master and name it according to what you will create (e.g. `wifi-tutorial`). Make a copy of the `template` folder and modify that if you're creating a new document.

When you're done with a draft you can create a pull request. This will give the content team the possibility to review it and leave comments or request changes. During this review process you can continue to push commits to the same branch. They will show up in the pull request automatically. Once the pull request gests merged into master, the content will be deployed to the staging server where you will be able to have a final look on how it looks on the website. When everything looks fine, one of the repository maintainers will create a release of the latest version. This will then be automatically deployed to the production server.

# Tutorial Guidelines

Before you want to jump into writing a tutorial its important that you are aware what a tutorial focuses on and what distinguishes them from other articles. Below the main characteristics of tutorials are listed:

* Teaches the user about a particular core feature of the board.

* Provides  step-by-step instructions on how one can use this feature in a practical sense.

* Aims to provide both the skills and the technical knowledge around this core feature.

## Tutorial Structure

All tutorials must follow accurately the structure and features below explained in order to be accepted and published in the Arduino Pro website.

### TITLE

Title of the tutorial which is directly linked to the feature of the board the tutorial covers.

### INTRODUCTION

A short introductory paragraph that summarises what the tutorial is about   ( about 150 - 200 words ).

This section includes :

* What you will learn - bullet points of the learning objectives

* Required hardware and software - list of al the tools required for learning all that is explained in the tutorial

### FEATURE DESCRIPTION

Brief explanation of the topic of the tutorial. Highlight the relevant points and attach external  links from trusted websites that a user can use for further inquiry ( about 250 - 300 words )

### STEP BY STEP GUIDE

The practical part of the tutorial where users learn how to use a particular feature on which the tutorial is about. This guide is broken in to several easily digestible steps with images that the users will go through to accomplish the learning objectives

### CONCLUSION

Concludes the tutorial by summarizing what the user has learnt through the tutorial (about 100 words).

### NEXT STEPS

Describes the next steps that are ideal for the user to further his knowledge by listing out the next relevant tutorials.

### TROUBLESHOOTING  - Optional

Provides some useful tips on handling the most common programming errors, technical and library issues.

## Creating Images for Tutorials
All Images used in the tutorials are created on Figma and are stored in this folder â†’ https://www.figma.com/file/KGws1Zgno20qyuMhmdPLXi/H7-Tutorials. The resolution of the images must be 1920 * 1080 pixels and should be exported as a SVG or PNG file depending on the type of visual content.
