# BLE on the Portenta H7 For Arduino
In this tutorial we will enable low energy bluetooth (BLE) on the Portenta H7 to allow an external bluetooth program to control the on-board LED either by turning it on or off. 

## What you will learn
-   How to enable BLE on the Protenta H7
-   How to connect the Portenta to an external BLE Mobile Application (In this case nrfconnect by Nordic software)
-   How to turn on and off the Portenta H7 on-board LED
-   NEXT STEPS
-   Using two Portenta's (or other BLE capable Arduino devices)
-   Upload a program to a Portenta to control the LED's on mulitple BLE devices (The BLE device local name must include "LED")

## Required hardware and software
-   Portenta H7 board (<https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-h7>)
-   USB C cable (either USB A to USB C or USB C to USB C)
-   Arduino IDE 1.8.13+  or Arduino Pro IDE 0.0.4+ 
-   Nordic mobile app *nrfconnect* or equivalent to connect to bluetooth devices. Platforms [nrfconnect for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect/id1054362403?ls=1&mt=8) or [nrfconnect for android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp)

# Portenta and Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) 
Compared to Classic Bluetooth, Low Energy Bluetooth is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communication range. Mobile operating systems including iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry, as well as macOS, Linux, Windows 8 and Windows 10, natively support Bluetooth Low Energy. From [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy). 

In our example we use a pre-defined bluetooth number code pre-setup for controlling a devices LED's

```BLEService ledService("19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214"); // BLE LED Service```

These codes are very long, but in our example it is always the same code.

These GATT codes can be found on the internet. One example location is [here](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/characteristics/)

# Configuring the Development Environment
You will need to install the "ArduinoBLEE" library on whatever Arduino IDE you are using. For this example we will use the Regular Arduino IDE.
To install the library File --> Manage Libarary--> type "ArduinoBLE" click install

## 1. The Basic Setup
We are going to upload a basic on-board LED controlling Bluetooth program to the Portenta H7 board and then use a mobile bluetooth connection app to turn the LED on and off. (Reminder that on the Portenta the onboard LED is turn on by setting digitalWrite to LOW and off by setting digitalWrite to HIGH, reverse of non-pro Arduinos. This arraingment is safer for the board as a way to protect the board LED.)  

## 2. Uploading the BLE sketch
Let's program the Portenta with the classic blink example to check if the connection to the board works:

-   Copy and paste the following code into a new sketch in your IDE. 

```

#include <ArduinoBLE.h>

BLEService ledService("19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214"); // BLE LED Service

// BLE LED Switch Characteristic - custom 128-bit UUID, read and writable by central
BLEByteCharacteristic switchCharacteristic("19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214", BLERead | BLEWrite);

const int ledPin = LED_BUILTIN; // pin to use for the LED

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  //while (!Serial);   // need this gone when disconected from computer

  // set LED pin to output mode
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);

  // begin initialization
  if (!BLE.begin()) {
    Serial.println("starting BLE failed!");

    while (1);
  }

  // set advertised local name and service UUID:
  BLE.setLocalName("LED-Portenta-01");
  BLE.setAdvertisedService(ledService);

  // add the characteristic to the service
  ledService.addCharacteristic(switchCharacteristic);

  // add service
  BLE.addService(ledService);

  // set the initial value for the characeristic:
  switchCharacteristic.writeValue(0);

  // start advertising
  BLE.advertise();
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  Serial.println("BLE LED-Distance-Control");
}

void loop() {
  // listen for BLE peripherals to connect:
  BLEDevice central = BLE.central();

  // if a central is connected to peripheral:
  if (central) {
    Serial.print("Connected to central: ");
    // print the central's MAC address:
    Serial.println(central.address());;
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);

    // while the central is still connected to peripheral:
    while (central.connected()) {
      // if the remote device wrote to the characteristic,
      // use the value to control the LED:
      if (switchCharacteristic.written()) {
        if (switchCharacteristic.value()) {   // any value other than 0
          Serial.println("LED off");
          digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);         // will turn the Portenta LED off, weird
        } else {                             
          Serial.println(F("LED on"));
          digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);          // will turn the Portenta LED on, weird
        }
      }
    }

    // when the central disconnects, print it out:
    Serial.print(F("Disconnected from central: "));
    Serial.println(central.address());    
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  }
}

```


- Connect your portenta using the "C" usb cable to your computer and double press the reset button so the on-board LED is slowly pulsing green
- Set Tools - Board to Portenta H7 (M7 core)  ![Board-manager](assets/por-ard-ble-choose-board.png)
- Use Tools - Choose the port to find your Portenta  ![Choose correct port](assets/por-ard-ble-choose-port2.png)
- Save your file
- Upload the above file to your Portenta
- Use tools - Port to find out if the Portenta has auto changed ports
- use Tools Serial Monitor to view printout from your device
- On your mobile device load *nrfconnect* or ewuivalent and scan for the BLE connection called "LED..."
- connect with the device, find the 2 way communication tabs and type either "00" or "01" to turn the LED on or off 



# Conclusion
If all went well you have proved that you can connect your Portenta with your cell phone and have some communication abilities between the two devices  

# Next Steps  
-   Now if you have a second Portenta or BLE capable device such as the Arduino Nano 33 IOT or Nano 33 BLE or Nano 33 BLE Sense and a few other boards you can use your Portenta to flash the LED's on mulitple BLE devices. Load the above code on several devices and use nrfconnect to check that they are working.
- Look for this line in your code and change the name slightly for each device. It must still contain the word "LED" as the next program scans for that word
```

  // set advertised local name and service UUID:
  BLE.setLocalName("LED-Portenta-01");
```

- Check using nrfconnect that the above devices show up with different names.
- on your portenta load the following code

```
#include <ArduinoBLE.h>

// variables for button

void setup() {
  pinMode(LEDB, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
 // while (!Serial);  //This is not useful when it is self powered

  // initialize the BLE hardware
  BLE.begin();
  Serial.println("BLE Central - LED control");

  // start scanning for LED BLE peripherals
  BLE.scanForUuid("19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214");
}

void loop() {
  // check if a peripheral has been discovered
  BLEDevice peripheral = BLE.available();

  if (peripheral) {
    // discovered a peripheral, print out address, local name, and advertised service
    Serial.print("Found ");
    Serial.print(peripheral.address());
    Serial.print(" '");
    Serial.print(peripheral.localName());
    Serial.print("' ");
    Serial.print(peripheral.advertisedServiceUuid());
    Serial.println();

    if (peripheral.localName().indexOf("LED") < 0) {
          Serial.println("No 'LED' in name");
      return;  // If the name doeshn't have "LED" in it then ignore it
    }

    // stop scanning
    BLE.stopScan();

    controlLed(peripheral);

    // peripheral disconnected, start scanning again
    BLE.scanForUuid("19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214");
  }
}

void controlLed(BLEDevice peripheral) {
  // connect to the peripheral
  Serial.println("Connecting ...");

  if (peripheral.connect()) {
    Serial.println("Connected");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Failed to connect!");
    return;
  }

  // discover peripheral attributes
  Serial.println("Discovering attributes ...");
  if (peripheral.discoverAttributes()) {
    Serial.println("Attributes discovered");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Attribute discovery failed!");
    peripheral.disconnect();
    return;
  }

  // retrieve the LED characteristic
  //BLECharacteristic ledCharacteristic = peripheral.characteristic("19b10001-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214");  //weird this broke it
  BLECharacteristic ledCharacteristic = peripheral.characteristic("19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214"); 
                                                                 

  if (!ledCharacteristic) {
    Serial.println("Peripheral does not have LED characteristic!");
    peripheral.disconnect();
    return;
  } else if (!ledCharacteristic.canWrite()) {
    Serial.println("Peripheral does not have a writable LED characteristic!");
    peripheral.disconnect();
    return;
  }

  while (peripheral.connected()) {
    // while the peripheral is connected
        
        digitalWrite(LEDB, LOW); //weird turns blue on
        Serial.println("flashing the LED on the device");
        ledCharacteristic.writeValue((byte)0x01);
        delay(500);
        ledCharacteristic.writeValue((byte)0x00);
        delay(500);        
        ledCharacteristic.writeValue((byte)0x01);
        delay(500);
        ledCharacteristic.writeValue((byte)0x00);
        delay(500);
        
        peripheral.disconnect();       
       digitalWrite(LEDB, HIGH); // weird turns blue off
    
  }

  Serial.println("Peripheral disconnected");
}

```
- upload the above code to your Portenta
- open the tools --> serial monitor (note you may have to search for the PORT)
- watch the serial ouput as the Portenta finds the BLE devices and flashes their on-board LED's
- Physicially watch the devices. When the Portenta on-board LED flashes blue it has found another device and that devices on-board LED should flash.


# Troubleshooting
## Sketch Upload Troubleshooting
If trying to upload a sketch but you receive an error message, saying that the upload has failed you can try to upload the sketch while the Portenta H7 is in bootloader mode. To do so you need to double click the reset button. The green LED will start fading in and out. Try to upload the sketch again. The green LED will stop fading when the upload completes.
