# Setting Up Portenta H7 For Arduino
Congratulations on your purchase of one of our most powerful microcontroller boards to date! We know you are eager to try out your new board but before you can start using the Portenta H7 to run Arduino sketches you need to configure your computer and the Arduino IDE. This tutorial teaches you how to set up the board, how to configure your computer and how to run the classic Arduino blink example  to verify if the configuration was successful.

One of the benefits of the Portenta H7 is that it supports different types of software cores. A core is the software API for a particular set of processors. It is the API that provides functions such as digitalRead(), analogWrite(), millis() etc. which directly operate on the hardware.

At the moment of writing the tutorial, there is an Arduino core and a MicroPython core available for working with Portenta. The latter one allows you to write sketches in the popular programming language Python rather than C or C++ and run them on the Portenta H7.

This tutorial focuses on the Arduino core which allows you to benefit from the thousands of existing Arduino libraries and code examples written in C and C++ which are compatible with the Arduino core. A tutorial about setting the Portenta H7 up for development with the MicroPython core will be released soon.

## What you will learn
-   About the Arduino and Mbed operating system (Mbed OS) stack 
-   Installing the Mbed library  
-   Controlling the built in LED on the Portenta board

## Required hardware and software
-   Portenta H7 board (<https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-h7>)
-   USB C cable (either USB A to USB C or USB C to USB C)
-   Arduino IDE 1.8.10+  or Arduino Pro IDE 0.0.4+ 

# Portenta and The Arduino Core
The Portenta H7 is equipped with two Arm Cortex ST processors (Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7) which run the Mbed OS.  Mbed OS is an embedded real time operating system (RTOS) designed specifically for microcontrollers to run IoT applications on low power. A real-time operating system is an operating system designed to run real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. [Here](https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/white-papers/07/what-is-a-real-time-operating-system--rtos--.html) you can read more about real time operating systems.

The Arduino core for the Portenta H7 sits on top of the Mbed OS and allows to develop applications using Mbed OS APIs which handle for example storage, connectivity, security and other hardware interfacing. [Here](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.15/apis/index.html) you can read more about the Mbed OS APIs. However, taking advantage of the Arm® Mbed™ real time operating system's powerful features can be a complicated process. Therefore we simplified that process by allowing you to run Arduino sketches on top of it.

# Configuring the Development Environment
In this section, we will guide you through a step-by-step process of setting up your Portenta board for running an Arduino Sketch that blinks the built-in RGB LED.

## 1. The Basic Setup
Let's begin by Plug-in your Portenta to your computer using the appropriate USB C cable. Next, open your IDE and make sure that you have the right version of the Arduino IDE or the PRO IDE downloaded on to your computer.

![The Portenta H7 can be connected to the computer using an appropriate USB-C cable](assets/por_ard_gs_basic_setup.svg?sanitize=true)


## 2. Making the Mbed cores available to the Arduino IDE's boards manager 
This process may be different in function on the Arduino IDE you are using, we will explain how to do it for the Arduino IDE and for the Arduino PRO IDE

### Arduino IDE
In order to download the Mbed cores which are required to run Arduino sketches on Portenta H7's processors we need to add an additional URL to the boards manager. To do so, in your Arduino IDE:

Open to the File > Preferences and paste the following URL in the Additional Boards Manager URLs field: [https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_mbed_index.json](http://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_mbed_index.json)

![In order to see the Mbed core in the board manager, an additional URL needs to be added.](assets/por_ard_gs_bm_url.png)

Once you have inserted the link as shown in the image above, click on the "OK" button.

### Arduino PRO IDE
If you're using the Arduino Pro IDE, the Mbed cores have to be made available through the Arduino Command Line Interface (Arduino CLI). If you haven't installed the Arduino CLI yet, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli#how-to-install)[.](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli#how-to-install) You can verify if the required core is already installed by executing the following command in your terminal:

```text
$ arduino-cli core list
```

If the core "arduino:mbed" with a version 1.9.5 or newer is in that list, you are all set. Otherwise you will need to add the URL to the Mbed core packages as an additional board manager URL to the config file. If you haven't created a config file yet, execute the following command:

```text
$ arduino-cli config init
```

Add the URL to the config file:

```yml
board_manager:
additional_urls: [http://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_mbed_index.json]
```

Update the core list index by executing the following command:

```text
$ arduino-cli core update-index
```

Once the commands have completed you will see the Mbed core in the Pro IDE boards manager.  
More information on how to get started with the Arduino CLI can be found [here](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/getting-started/):

## 3. Adding the Portenta to the list of available boards 
This step is the same for both the classic IDE and the Pro IDE. Open the board manager and search for "mbed".  Find the Arduino mbed-enabled Boards library and click on "Install" to install the latest version of the mbed core (1.9.6 at the time of writing this tutorial).

**Note:** If you have previously installed the Nano 33 BLE core  it will be updated by following this step.

![Also in the Pro IDE, a search for "mbed" reveals the core that needs to be installed to support Portenta H7.](assets/por_ard_gs_bm_core_pro_ide.png)


## 4. Install the USB driver (Windows only)
This step is only needed for Microsoft Windows users and only needs to be done once. To be able to recognise the Portenta H7 in windows you need to install a generic USB device driver. Zadig is an open source software that can be used for this. Install[ Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/), then connect your portenta with the USB cable and assign WinUSB to Portenta H7 Bootloader as shown in the image below. To finish click on the Install Driver button.

![Assigning WinUSB to Portenta H7 Bootloader.](assets/por_ard_gs_zadig_driver.png)


## 5. Verify the USB connection  (Windows only)
In this step you will make sure that the drivers are installed correctly and Windows is able to detect the Portenta H7. To do so open the Windows Device manager and if everything is set up correctly you will be able to see your device listed under USB devices. Otherwise go back to step 4 and try to re-install the drivers.

![If the device driver is set up correctly, the Portenta H7 will be listed in the device manager under USB devices.](assets/por_ard_gs_usb_driver_win.png)

## 6. Uploading the classic blink sketch
Let's program the Portenta with the classic blink example to check if the connection to the board works:

-   In the classic Arduino IDE open the blink example by clicking the menu entry File->Examples->01.Basics->Blink. 
-   In the Arduino Pro IDE Copy and paste the following code into a new sketch in your IDE. 

```cpp
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
    // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    delay(1000); // wait for a second
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(1000); // wait for a second
}
```

For Portenta H7  LED_BUILTIN  represents the built-in RGB LED on the board in green color.

**Note:** The individual colours of the built-in RGB LED can be accessed and controlled separately. In the tutorial "Dual Core Processing"  you will learn how to control the LED to light it in different colors

## 7. Upload the blink sketch 
Now it's time to upload the sketch and see if the LED will start to blink. Make sure you select Arduino Portenta H7 (M7 core) as the board and the port to which the Portenta H7 is connected. If the Portenta H7 doesn't show up in the list of ports, go back to step 5 and make sure that the drivers are installed correctly. Once selected click Upload. Once uploaded the built-in LED should start blinking with an interval of 1 second.

**Note:** The Portenta H7 has an M7 and an M4 processor which run separate cores. That's why you need to select the one to which you want to upload your sketch to (check out the tutorial "Dual Core Processing" to learn more about Portenta's processors).

# Conclusion
You have now configured your Portenta board to run Arduino sketches. Along with that you gained an understanding of how the Arduino Core runs on top of Mbed OS.  

# Next Steps
-   Proceed with the next tutorial "Dual Core Processing" to learn how to make use of Portenta H7's two processors to do two separate tasks simultaneously.
-   Read more about why we chose Mbed as as the foundation [here](https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/07/31/why-we-chose-to-build-the-arduino-nano-33-ble-core-on-mbed-os/)

# Troubleshooting
## Sketch Upload Troubleshooting
If trying to upload a sketch but you receive an error message, saying that the upload has failed you can try to upload the sketch while the Portenta H7 is in bootloader mode. To do so you need to double click the reset button. The green LED will start fading in and out. Try to upload the sketch again. The green LED will stop fading when the upload completes.
