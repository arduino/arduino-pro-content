# Creating GUIs With LVGL  
In this tutorial you will learn to use [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) to create a simple graphical user interface that consists of a button with an inner text label that updates itself.

## What You Will Learn
-   Understanding the structure to build LVGL interfaces.
-   Building a simple UI with a text label and a button. 
-   Configuring the setup to display the User-Interface. 

## Required Hardware and Software
-   Portenta H7 board (<https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-h7>)
-   USB C cable (either USB A to USB C or USB C to USB C)
-   Arduino IDE 1.8.10+  or Arduino Pro IDE 0.0.4+ 
-   USB-C hub with HDMI ([The one we used](https://www.dustinhome.se/product/5011166993/travel-port-usb-c-total))
-   External monitor 
-   HDMI cable 

# The Light and Versatile Graphics Library

Graphical User interfaces are necessary for visualising information and interacting with certain aspects of an application. The Light and Versatile Graphics Library, also known as [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/), is an open-sourced library used to create graphical user-interfaces for microcontrollers and high-end processors. The light weight embedded library provides all the necessary widgets and user interface elements that will allow you to easily create user interfaces for displays like OLED, TFT, monitors, Drive Monochrom and touch screens.

# Building a simple GUI 

This tutorial will guide you to build a basic user interface using LVGL and the USBhost Library that you will have download using the Arduino Library Manager. The setup for this tutorial requires you to first to upload the finished sketch file to the Portenta board where it converts the board into a USB host Device. You will then connect the board to a USB-hub to in order to connect it to an external monitor. Once the hub is powered externally, a graphical user interface with a button and a text-field will be displayed on the screen.

## 1. The Basic Setup

Begin by plugging your Portenta board into the computer using a USB-C cable and open the Arduino IDE or the Arduino Pro IDE. If this is your first time running Arduino sketch files on the board, we suggest you check out how to [set up the Portenta H7 for Arduino](https://github.com/bcmi-labs/arduino-pro-content/blob/master/content/tutorials/portenta-h7/por-ard-usb/por-ard-gs) before you proceed.

## 2. Download the lvgl library

Next, select *Portenta* in the **Tools -> Board** menu before installing [lvgl](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl) from the Library Manager. To do so, go to **Sketch** **->** **Include Libraries** **-> Manage Libraries** and search for *LVGL*. Download **lvgl by [kisvegabor](https://github.com/kisvegabor)**.  

![por_ard_lvgl_download_library](assets/por_ard_lvgl_select_library.svg)

   ***Make sure you have selected the right board inside Tools -> Board, otherwise you won't see the library or you may install a library that is not compatible with Portenta .***

## 3. Add the button widget  

Let's start by including the libraries that we are going to use.

```c++
#include "Portenta_LittleVGL.h"
#include "USBHost.h"
```

Create a custom button widget using the `lv_btn` object. This object allows for an inner label, which text can easily be configured. The following lines of code initialise the button variable and its label, you can add them at the beginning of your sketch.

```cpp
static lv_obj_t *lv_btn;
static lv_obj_t *myCustomLabel;
```

Then inside the `setup()` configure the type, style and the position of the button.

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  portenta_init_video();

  // Setting up the Button
  lv_btn = lv_btn_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
  lv_obj_align(lv_btn, NULL, LV_ALIGN_CENTER, 0, -40);          // We move it to the center of the screen and align it centered
  //lv_obj_set_event_cb(lv_btn, event_handler);                 // If you want to handle the buttonâ€™s callback create an event_handler function

  // Setting up inner Label
  myCustomLabel = lv_label_create(lv_btn, NULL);                // We make the object be a label widget, lv_btn child     
  lv_label_set_text(myCustomLabel , "Button");                  // We set the default text
}
```

To finish, in the loop, it calls to the `lv_task_handler()` which will update the output to the external monitor. 

```c++
void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  lv_task_handler();
}
```

This sketch creates a button that will be displayed in the monitor. The `lv_btn` object represents our button and the `myCustomLabel` object is used to set the inner text.

## 4. Connect an external monitor

Compile and upload the sketch to your Portenta H7. At this point your board becomes the host. Unplug the board from your computer and connect it to the USB-hub along with a monitor that is connected to the HDMI port. Power up your hub by connecting it to an external power source and the monitor will display a button with the inner text `Button`. 

   ![por_ard_lvgl_connect_monitor](assets/por_ard_lvgl_connect_monitor.svg)

   ***If you aren't familiar how the USB host works, we recommend you to have a look at the [USB Host tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/tutorials/portenta-h7/por-ard-usb )***

Our button object currently has LVGL's default style. If you want to customise the button's style you can have a look at LVGL's documentation <https://docs.lvgl.io/latest/en/html/widgets/btn.html#simple-buttons>

## 5. Create a simple counter

Once you know that it is working, let's create a counter that increases each second and update it in the screen. To do so, we will create a label that is going to be updated periodically and then change its value in the screen, this is possible using the LVGL feature called 'Task'. 

First we create a new task declaration and the counter variable at the beginning of the program (before the `setup()` function).

```cpp
static lv_obj_t * lv_btn;
static lv_obj_t * myCustomLabel;

static void label_Task(lv_task_t * myTask);
uint32_t count = 0;
```

Then we create the function that is going to update the value of the counter and its label (after and outside the `loop()` function).

```cpp
static void label_Task(lv_task_t * myTask) {
   //printf("count: %d\n", count);                        // We can see the count in the Serial monitor
   lv_label_set_text_fmt(myCustomLabel, "%d" , count);    // Update the text of the label
   count++;                                               // Increase the count number
}
```

Finally, as the last line inside the `setup()` function, we create the task that calls our `label_Task()` function every second.

```cpp
 void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial1.begin(115200);

  portenta_init_video();

  // Setting up the Button
  lv_btn = lv_btn_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
  lv_obj_align(lv_btn, NULL, LV_ALIGN_CENTER, -40, -40);
  //lv_obj_set_event_cb(lv_btn, event_handler);        // If you want to handle the button's callback create an event_handler function

  // Setting up inner Label
  myCustomLabel = lv_label_create(lv_btn, NULL);       // We make the object be a label widget, lv_btn child
  lv_label_set_text(myCustomLabel , "Button");         // We set the default text

  // Create a task
  lv_task_create(label_Task, 1000, LV_TASK_PRIO_MID, NULL);
}
```

## 6. Upload the Sketch

This is the complete sketch of the tutorial that updates the button text with a counter. Upload the sketch to your Portenta H7 and connect it to an external monitor as described in Step 4. 

```c++
#include "Portenta_LittleVGL.h"
#include "USBHost.h"

static lv_obj_t * lv_btn;
static lv_obj_t * myCustomLabel;
static void label_Task(lv_task_t * myTask);
uint32_t count = 0;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial1.begin(115200);
  portenta_init_video();
  // Setting up the Button
  lv_btn = lv_btn_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
  lv_obj_align(lv_btn, NULL, LV_ALIGN_CENTER, -40, -40);
  //lv_obj_set_event_cb(lv_btn, event_handler);        // If you want to handle the button's callback create an event_handler function
  // Setting up inner Label
  myCustomLabel = lv_label_create(lv_btn, NULL);       // We make the object be a label widget, lv_btn child
  lv_label_set_text(myCustomLabel , "Button");         // We set the default text
  // Create a task
  lv_task_create(label_Task, 1000, LV_TASK_PRIO_MID, NULL);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  lv_task_handler();
  
}

static void label_Task(lv_task_t * myTask) {
  //printf("count: %d\n", count);                      // We can see the count in the Serial monitor
  lv_label_set_text_fmt(myCustomLabel, "%d" , count);  // Update the text from the label
  count++;                                             // Increase the count number
}
```

# Conclusion

This tutorial shows how to build a simple user interface with your Portenta. Starting with a static view in the monitor and then converting it into a simple dynamic application that features an updating variable on the screen. The tutorial also shows how to  use the "task" feature of LVGL to run instructions recurrently.

# Next Steps
Now that you know how to build a simple UI for a screen, you can try to add more labels to the screen to show different stuff. Also be alerted because we will continue growing the tutorials about how to combine LVGL with other features of your Portenta.

# Troubleshooting
## Not updating the text with the count
* Make sure that the label and task are declared on top of the sketch, outside the `setup()` and `loop()` like a normal variable.
* Check if the task has the same structure in the first declaration and the function creation.
* Look inside the `loop()` and see if `lv_task_handler()` is there.
* Try to uncomment the `printf` inside the task to check if the Serial Monitor its updating the count.

## Sketch Upload Troubleshooting
* Make sure you set the board in bootloader mode, by clicking twice the reset button, then you should see the built-in LED fading.
* If you uploaded the sketch and you don't have any output in the display, make sure you have `portenta_init_video()` in the `setup()`.
* Unplug and plug back the HDMI cable.
* Reset the Portenta once it's connected to the USB-hub.
