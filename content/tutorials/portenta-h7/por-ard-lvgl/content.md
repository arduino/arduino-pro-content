# Creating GUIs With LVGL  
Some applications developed to run on the portentea needs a graphical user interface to display information with the user can interact with. in this tutorial you will learn how to create A 

## What you will learn

-   C

## Required hardware and software
-   Portenta H7 board (<https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-h7>)
-   USB C cable (either USB A to USB C or USB C to USB C)
-   Arduino IDE 1.8.10+  or Arduino Pro IDE 0.0.4+ 
-   USB 
-   External monitor 
-   HDMI cable 

# Portenta and The ...

Graphical User interfaces are necessary for visualising information and interacting with the board. Information like performances, widgets and pages. 

LVGL - create user interfaces - platform independant - use one library with microcontrollers or high-end processors - light weight embedded library - for displays : OLED, TFT, monitors, Drive Monochrom and touch screens - open source

Provides all the necessary widgets - https://docs.lvgl.io/v7/en/html/widgets/index.html 

handles all the events such as pressed , focused refereshed etc 

customizing their styles can be applied to parts objects to change their styles, styles can be cascaded. 



the lvgl arduino library can

Upload the example, create widgets and display it on the monitor 

1. The Basic Setup

Begin by plugging in your Portenta board to the computer using a USB-C cable and open the Arduino IDE or the Arduino Pro IDE. If this is your first time running Arduino sketch files on the board, we suggest you check out how to [set up the Portenta H7 for Arduino](https://github.com/bcmi-labs/arduino-pro-content/blob/master/content/tutorials/portenta-h7/por-ard-usb/por-ard-gs) before you proceed.

2. Download the lvgl library 

Library manager - LVGL and dowload the lvgl library.

2. Portenta_lvgl example sketch

   Find the example at 

   ![por_ard_lvgl_select_example]()

   Scroll to the bottom of the sketch and uncomment the Hello world lines. 

   ![por_ard_lvgl_select_example]() 

   upload the sketch, 
   Compile and run the sketch,

   Note : if you cant find the sketch, make sure you have selected the right board inside **Tools > Boards** 

3. Connect an external monitor the sketch 

   once the sketch has finished uploading to the board.  At the point the Portent board becomes needs to be removed as it behaves as the USB host in this case. it needs to be plugged to a USB hub through which you can attach a HDMI port connected to an external moniter

4. Adding a widget 

   Now lets add a widget a . lets add this line to the setup

   `lv_obj_t * myCustomLabel;`
