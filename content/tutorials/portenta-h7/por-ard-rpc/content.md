# Using RPC serial communication
In this tutorial you will learn what RPC is and will develop an application that illustrates this concept. By doing this, you will understand what RPC is and how to use the `RPC_internal.h` library that allows to take advantage of the RPC feature of yoour Portenta H7.    

## What You Will Learn
-   What is RPC and its applications
-   Understanding the RPC library
-   Illustrate what you have learned with an example sketch

## Required Hardware and Software
-   Portenta H7 board (<https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-h7>)
-   USB C cable (either USB A to USB C or USB C to USB C)
-   Arduino IDE 1.8.10+  or Arduino Pro IDE 0.0.4+
-   USB
-   External monitor
-   HDMI cable

# What is RPC
A remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program calls for a procedure (set of instructions) to be executed in a different address space, for example on another computer or a different memory section of the device. In Portenta H7 for example, the M7 core is able to run a sketch which calls for a subroutine to be executed on M4 or vice versa. Once the procedure is run by the remote (server), the results of the subroutine are returned to the local computer (client) to carry on with the following instruction. RPC are based on a client-server relation model, in which the caller is the client and the executor is server.
