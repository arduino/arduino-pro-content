# Setting Up Portenta H7 For Arduino
It is possible to configure Portenta H7 to behave as a USB host in a way that we can connect peripherals such as keyboard or mouse to interact with the board. This way we could connect a keyboard to our portenta and input numbers or characters into our programs.

## What you will learn
-   How to configure the Portenta H7 as a USB host
-   What type of peripherals can we connect and how
-   To write a small program to read button presses from a keyboard

## Required hardware and software
-   Portenta H7 board (<https://store.arduino.cc/portenta-h7>)
-   USB C cable (either USB A to USB C or USB C to USB C)
-   Arduino IDE 1.8.10+  or Arduino Pro IDE 0.0.4+
